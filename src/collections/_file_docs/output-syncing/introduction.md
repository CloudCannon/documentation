Connecting a storage provider to output allows you to access the compiled output of a site. To connect an output branch, follow these instructions:

Go to *Site Settings* / *Files* / *Output Syncing* and click **Connect** next to your chosen provider. Providers will be configured once selected.

![Storage Providers interface](/images/files/output/storage-providers.png){: srcset="/images/files/output/storage-providers.png 800w, /images/files/output/storage-providers@2x.png 1600w"}{: .screenshot}

Once connected the compiled site will replace the contents of your provider. This process will repeat after every build.
