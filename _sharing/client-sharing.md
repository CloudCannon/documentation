Share your site with your clients without them having to create a CloudCannon account and use a seat on your pricing plan.

Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Sharing* section and enter a password:

![Client Sharing](/img/sharing/client-sharing.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/sharing/client-sharing.png 800w, /img/sharing/client-sharing@2x.png 1600w"}

Send your clients their website URL suffixed with **/update** (e.g. `http://example.com/update`) and have them enter the password. Once they've logged in, your client gets access to the [Visual Editor](/editing/visual-editor/) to edit content on their site.

### Interface

Customise the interface for your clients. You can provide documentation and support URLs. The support URL can be a `mailto:` link.

The preview URL overrides the link to the live site in the sidebar and header. It is useful for sites hosted externally or with redirects.

To change the URLs:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Interface* section
2. Enter the desired URLs (all are optional)
3. Click **Update Client Interface**

![Client Interface](/img/sharing/client-interface.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/sharing/client-interface.png 800w, /img/sharing/client-interface@2x.png 1600w"}
