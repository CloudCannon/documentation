Transfers allow one account to transfer the ownership of a site to another account. Transferring a site will transfer all data required to run that site. This may include SSL certificates, domain names, other sites under the same domain.

Transfers are a two step process; transfer requests and transfer confirmation.

### Initiating a transfer

To begin transferring a site:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Transfer Site*

Once the transfer request has been sent the receiving account must accept the transfer. If you are an owner/administrator of the Organisation you are transferring to, the transfer is automatically accepted.

To transfer to an Organisation you must first be a part of that team. To transfer to a Organisation you don't have access, first transfer to a user within the team.
