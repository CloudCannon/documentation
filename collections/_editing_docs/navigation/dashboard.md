The Dashboard gives editors a breakdown of the main sections of the site.

![Example Dashboard](/images/editing/navigation/dashboard.png){: .screenshot srcset="/images/editing/navigation/dashboard.png 800w, /images/editing/navigation/dashboard@2x.png 1600w"}

This has three main sections: Site Breakdown, Main Actions, and Recent Activity.

### Site Breakdown

The site breakdown is a representation of the [Explore](/editing/navigation/explore/) navigation. View options are inherited from the [explore settings](/editing/navigation/explore/).

### Main Actions

Sits below the site breakdown and defaults to having a single action (View live site). You can configure two more options in the&nbsp;[client interface](/sharing/client-sharing/client-sharing/#interface).

### Recent Activity

This is a summary of the last six actions to occur on the site. You can view a full history in the *Developer / Reports* section.
