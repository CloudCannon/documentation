Collaborators are other CloudCannon users you have given access to one or more sites. Collaborators have two different share levels:

*Editors* make content changes with the [Visual Editor](/editing/editors/visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/editing/editors/content-editor/) and *Explore* section. They have access to the recent activity in the *Reports* section. The [Source Editor](/editing/editors/source-editor/), *Site Settings* and *File Browser* are hidden and inaccessible.

*Technical Editors* have access to all files, editors, the *Site Settings* are hidden and inaccessible.

> Consider [creating an organisation](/organisations/introduction/) with your team members to give them access to all sites instead.
