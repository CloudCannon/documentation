You will already have an Organisation if you have created a CloudCannon account. Organisations allow a team to be defined and permissions to be granted at different levels.

You can update your Organisation's branding, colour, and logo from the Organisation Settiings menu. See the&nbsp;[Organisation Branding](/organisations/branding/)guide for detailed instructions.

### Adding a new Organisation

To create your first Organisation:

1. Click **Create Organisation** in the *Account Menu* in the sidebar
2. Fill in all of the fields available and submit the form

Once created, a new start screen is shown to select between your organisations. Alternatively, you can use the *Account Menu* for quick access to organisations.
