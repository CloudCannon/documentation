The majority of CloudCannon features require a paid account. This page documents everything you need to know about paying for CloudCannon.

### Payment Methods

We currently accept Visa and Mastercard credit cards for payment for paid plans and invoicing on Enterprise plans.

### Upgrading / Downgrading

When upgrading or downgrading your account we perform the following actions:

1. Calculate the time left on your billing period on your current plan and credit this on your next invoice

2. Calculate the time left on your billing period on your new plan and debit this on your next invoice

3. On your next invoice you will see these adjustments.

### Failed Payments

We realise credit cards sometimes decline for unknown reasons so we try to give you plenty of time to try a new payment method. After a failed payment, we retry the payment four times over the next three weeks. If we're still unsuccessful during this period we will cancel your CloudCannon subscription and downgrade your account to our free plan.

If you need more leeway that this please reach out to [support](https://cloudcannon.com/contact/) and tell us about your situation.
