Uploading files through a web browser is the fastest way to get a website live on CloudCannon.

To upload files from the *File Browser*:

1. Open the *Add Files* menu
2. Select **Upload files** or **Upload a folder**

Alternatively, drag and drop files into the *File Browser*.
{: .info}

Uploading a folder uploads all files inside the folder, rather than the folder itself.

Some browsers do not support folder upload. CloudCannon recommends syncing with a storage provider in this case.

Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser. Unsupported files are greyed out, while any files with errors uploading are shown red.

If the site is synced with a storage provider, CloudCannon pushes the files there as well.
